# Quiet Light

**Team:** Svetlana Berkmiller, Jasmina Kramer, Vivien Cai

## About

This project was developed during our international seminar week (5 days) in the 4th semester at HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd. The images in this website showcase a part of our work during these 5 days.

The assignment was to create responsible lighting for outdoor areas on our university campus.

We created lighting solutions tailored to the specific needs of different outdoor areas. The overall concept focuses on calm and soothing lighting moods that enhance the evening atmosphere without being intrusive.
